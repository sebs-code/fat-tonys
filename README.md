## What is Fat Tony's?  
Fat Tonys is a podcast & community designed to help people navigate modernity - inspired by the works of Nassim Taleb. People in the Fat Tony's community use his (and other related ideas) to build an anti-fragile life. This is about practical application, NOT theory.
  
The podcast focuses on (but is not limited to) tawking to REAL LIFE experts. Expect conversation around Anti-fragility, Convexity, Non linearity, Deadlifts, Fasting, Flaneuring, Cooking, Poetry, Risk, Movies, Music, and acquiring freedom / f*ck you money. Above all else, Fat Tony's is a decentralised community. Being a fan of Nassim Taleb acts as a filter, and gives us a great group of people willing to share knowledge, tawk, and help improve each other's lives. We've had Fat Tony's members who have written books, started companies, collaborated on design projects, and established long lasting real world friendships.
  
We share ideas, resources, and support for navigating modernity on this website, Twitter, through our Podcast and our Youtube Channel. We will host regular events, tawks, and book clubs. [Follow us on Twitter](http://x.com/FatTonysPodcast) for more details.
