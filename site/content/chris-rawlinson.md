Ever wondered why traditional education still looks largely unchanged since the industrial revolution? Chris Rawlinson, founder of 42 Courses, takes us on a fascinating journey from his days as an Ogilvy advertising executive to revolutionising online learning through behavioural science.

Rawlinson explains how applying advertising principles to education led to a breakthrough approach - creating bite-sized, engaging content with immediate feedback rather than simply digitising academic lectures. This cross-industry innovation forms the foundation of 42 Courses, which partners with thought leaders like Rory Sutherland to deliver learning experiences designed for how people actually absorb information. The discussion reveals surprising insights about educational psychology, including the counterintuitive discovery that higher-priced courses are actually valued more highly by users, creating a tension between accessibility and perceived quality.

The conversation shifts to exploring how artificial intelligence is transforming personalised learning. Rawlinson shares how 42 Courses already uses AI to tailor content to individual learners' needs and industries, while acknowledging both current limitations and extraordinary future potential. Both host and guest share optimism about technology's democratising effect, not just on education but on entrepreneurship itself, as tools for creation become increasingly accessible to everyone. They envision a world where robotics and AI will do for manufacturing what digital tools have done for software - creating near-zero cost entrepreneurship opportunities across all industries.

What skills will matter most in this rapidly evolving landscape? According to Chris, critical thinking, curiosity, and an entrepreneurial mindset will be essential as we navigate a world of increasing technological capability and complexity. For a fascinating glimpse into the future of learning and work, this episode delivers powerful insights about how education is being reimagined for the digital age.
