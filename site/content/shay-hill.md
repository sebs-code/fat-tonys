Shay Hill joins Fat Tony's to talk about safety. Shay is an industrial safety and compliance expert, and is also the founder of foundationsafety.com, a skills based incident prevention consultancy. Shay is  a man of many talents, most recently having released his new book; Make Rules Without Making Enemies: How to Draw the Lines Without Drawing Fire. It was an absolute pleasure talking with Shay - I hope you enjoy our conversation as much as I did.
