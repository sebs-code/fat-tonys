What if the greatest threat to creative careers isn't competition but rather the rapid advancement of technology itself? In this thought-provoking conversation, wordsmith Leila Johnston pulls back the curtain on the real world of freelance writing.

Leila's journey from journalism to digital copywriting reveals the psychological challenges of freelancing – the constant pitching, the perpetual uncertainty, and the nagging feeling that AI might render an entire profession obsolete overnight. "I never feel safe professionally," she confesses, articulating a vulnerability many independent professionals will recognize but few discuss openly. Her candid insights offer valuable guidance for anyone navigating today's fractured career landscape, from building multiple income streams to securing longer contracts that provide both financial stability and the human connection of teamwork.

We also examine Leila's involvement with the Library of Mistakes, a library in Edinburgh dedicated to financial history and learning from past economic failures. Founded by Russell Napier, this institution represents a deliberate move away from the digital overwhelm toward thoughtful reflection on historical patterns. Through the library's collection of books, artifacts, and regular events featuring prominent financial thinkers, visitors gain perspective on current economic challenges by understanding their historical precedents.

Whether you're a creative professional concerned about AI's impact on your career, a freelancer seeking greater stability, or simply someone interested in how financial history shapes our present circumstances, this conversation offers both practical strategies and philosophical depth. As Leila reminds us, "People in the past were just people, which is people like we are now" – a simple but profound insight that might help us avoid repeating the mistakes of previous generations.
