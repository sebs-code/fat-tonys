In this episode, we talk to  Porkchop Express, who is known on Twitter for her love of killer boots, killer fashion, sardonic wit, but above all, her passion for Dostoevsky. Porkchop is going to be schooling us on Dostoevsky's work, how they can change your lives, from the existential crises depicted in Notes on the Underground, to the moral conflicts of crime and punishment, all the way through to the spiritual redemption found in The Brothers Karamazov.
